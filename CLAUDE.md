# Amanah Trader — Claude Code Working Notes

## What this is

A local-first, Shariah-compliant paper-trading control system. Deterministic Python agents
screen every order for Shariah compliance, option-structure permissibility, account-level Riba
exposure, and risk limits **before** it can enter the approval queue, and a human must type a
confirmation phrase before anything reaches the broker.

The point is not the screening — plenty of products screen stocks. The point is that the gate
chain **enforces** and **proves**: an order that fails any gate cannot be submitted, and every
decision is recorded with its evidence.

Broker: **Alpaca**, paper only.

## Safety rules (these override convenience)

- **Live trading must remain impossible.** `ALPACA_MODE` is pinned to `paper` in
  `config.load_settings()`, and `alpaca_paper_adapter.ALPACA_PAPER_BASE_URL` is a hardcoded
  paper host with no live URL anywhere in the module and no env var that can repoint it. The
  MCP transport forces `ALPACA_PAPER_TRADE=true` on the server it spawns.
- Broker submission stays opt-in behind `POST /paper/execute/{queue_id}` with the confirmation
  phrase `EXECUTE PAPER`.
- Do not bypass or weaken the Shariah, option-structure, account, risk, approval, or
  confirmation gates. If a gate is inconvenient, that is the gate working.
- Broker adapters perform **no** compliance checks of their own. They submit what an
  already-gated approval says to submit. Compliance lives in the gate chain, not the adapter.
- Never commit or print secrets from `backend/.env`. `.env` has never been committed — keep it
  that way. `backend/.env.example` documents the variables with empty values.
- Run the local tests before changing anything broker-facing.

## Architecture

```
Preview          POST /paper/preview
                   market data -> quant signal -> risk limits -> quote snapshot
                   carries asset_class + option_contract for option orders

Approval         POST /paper/approval
                   local_api.broker_account_context()  resolves live broker facts:
                     shares_held      <- portfolio_store.open_position_quantity
                     cash_collateral  <- settled cash (NEVER buying_power)
                     account_type     <- Alpaca multiplier (CASH / MARGIN)
                     uses_margin      <- conservative: account_type == MARGIN
                   shariah_candidate.build_shariah_candidate(...)  <-- the ONE gate entry point
                   approval_workflow.approve_candidate(...)
                     -> shariah_gate          is the company permissible?
                     -> option_structure_gate is the contract permissible?
                     -> account_shariah_gate  is the account free of Riba?
                   APPROVED_PAPER_READY | REJECT(reason)

Execution        POST /paper/execute/{queue_id}   requires "EXECUTE PAPER"
                   paper_execution.py re-audits the stored payload, re-checks reduce-only SELL
                   (equity only — a sell-to-open option is exempt; see Known limitations 4)
                   -> alpaca_paper_adapter.submit_paper_order(approval, broker)

Reconcile        POST /paper/reconcile/{queue_id}
                   -> portfolio_store.sync_filled_order  (equity only; see Known limitations)
```

### Module ownership

| Concern | Files |
|---|---|
| Broker + market data | `alpaca_paper_adapter.py`, `alpaca_market_data.py` |
| Gate chain | `shariah_gate.py`, `option_structure_gate.py`, `account_shariah_gate.py`, `shariah_candidate.py`, `agents/` |
| Compliance data | `sec_edgar_screen.py` (self-built SC screen), `zoya_compliance.py` (sandbox only) |
| Strategy | `option_strategy.py` — proposes a contract; approves nothing |
| Orchestration | `local_api.py`, `paper_execution.py`, `approval_workflow.py`, `agent_coordinator.py` |
| State | `approval_queue.py`, `portfolio_store.py`, `watchlist_store.py` |
| Legacy | `moomoo_*.py` — superseded by Alpaca, retained for history. Do not extend. |

**`shariah_candidate.build_shariah_candidate()` is the only surface a broker adapter talks to.**
Adapters never import a gate module directly. If something a gate needs isn't reaching it, fix
the plumbing on the adapter side rather than changing the gate contract.

## Configuration

Everything is read via `os.getenv` in `config.load_settings()` from `backend/.env`.
See `backend/.env.example` for the full list. The ones that change behaviour most:

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ALPACA_API_KEY_ID` / `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY` | — | Paper keys. User sets these; never ask for them in chat. |
| `ALPACA_MODE` | `paper` | Any other value raises at startup. |
| `PAPER_EXECUTION_ADAPTER` | `disabled` | `disabled` \| `fake` \| `alpaca` \| `alpaca_mcp` \| `moomoo` |
| `PAPER_EXECUTION_ENABLED` | `false` | Master lock on broker submission. |
| `MARKET_DATA_PROVIDER` | `alpaca` | `alpaca` \| `tiingo` |
| `ZOYA_ENVIRONMENT` | `sandbox` | **Sandbox returns randomized data.** See Known limitations. |
| `TRADING_MODE` | `approval` | `advisory` \| `approval` \| `autonomous_paper` |
| Risk limits | see example | `MAX_POSITION_PCT`, `MAX_TOTAL_EXPOSURE_PCT`, `MAX_LOSS_PER_TRADE_PCT`, `MAX_DAILY_LOSS_PCT`, `MAX_ORDERS_PER_DAY` |

`SHARIAH_UNIVERSE_PATH` and `SHARIAH_WIKI_PATH` default to committed in-repo copies
(`data/shariah-universe/`, `docs/shariah-policy/`), so a fresh clone runs with no `.env` at all.
Set them only to point at a larger private vault.

## Alpaca integration

Two transports, both paper-only, selected by `PAPER_EXECUTION_ADAPTER`:

- **`alpaca`** — REST over stdlib `urllib` against `https://paper-api.alpaca.markets`.
- **`alpaca_mcp`** — the official MCP server via `uvx alpaca-mcp-server` (needs `uv`; override
  the command with `ALPACA_MCP_COMMAND`). The server wraps every payload in a
  `{"_alpaca_mcp_security": {...}, "data": {...}}` trust envelope; `unwrap_mcp_envelope()`
  strips it. That envelope is a prompt-injection guard aimed at LLM callers — this adapter reads
  named fields out of `data` deterministically and never treats tool output as instructions.

Options are **Level 1 only**: sell covered call, sell cash-secured put, and closing those shorts.
Multi-leg spreads are rejected by design. Contracts are built as OCC-21 symbols with
`time_in_force=day` and an explicit `position_intent`.

Market data (`alpaca_market_data.py`) mirrors `tiingo_prices.fetch_eod_prices` exactly — same
signature, same bar shape — so `market_data.summarize_history` switches providers with nothing
downstream noticing. It also exposes `fetch_option_contracts` / `fetch_option_snapshots` /
`fetch_option_chain` for strike selection. On a plan that cannot query recent SIP data it
automatically retries on the IEX feed and labels the source `alpaca_iex`.

## Running it

From the repo root:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn local_api:app --app-dir backend --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

or `backend\run_local.ps1`. Dashboard: open `dashboard\index.html`.

Config check (prints booleans, never values):

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe backend\check_config.py
```

## Tests

Every test is a plain script with a `main()` that prints `PASS: ...`. No pytest. Run them
individually:

```

All 40 of those pass. There are 41 `test_*.py` files on disk; `test_moomoo.py` is the one
excluded, for the reason below. `check_moomoo_status()` pre-checks TCP reachability before
touching the moomoo
SDK, so a closed OpenD port fails in ~1.5s instead of the SDK's own multi-minute retry/backoff —
this is what used to make `test_local_api_smoke.py` and the dashboard's status refresh hang;
both now complete fast with no Moomoo gateway running. `test_moomoo.py` still hangs by design:
it instantiates the moomoo SDK directly, bypassing that pre-check, since its purpose is to
manually verify a *real* OpenD connection when you actually have one running — it is the one
suite not run as part of the regular list above.

### Testing conventions

- Network access goes through one replaceable module-level seam — `alpaca_request`,
  `alpaca_data_request`, `load_alpaca_mcp_client`, `check_alpaca_status`. Tests swap the seam;
  they never hit a real API.
- Prefer asserting the *request that was built*, not just the response that came back.
- When a test passes on the first run, break the code deliberately and confirm the test fails.
  Several real bugs in this repo were found exactly that way.

## Known limitations — read before claiming anything works

1. **US screening is live on SEC EDGAR, and every call is uncached.** `agents/shariah_agent.py`
   routes the US path to `sec_edgar_screen.check_us_symbol`, reporting `provider: SEC_EDGAR`.
   Zoya is no longer in any screening path; `zoya_compliance.py` remains only for reference,
   imported solely by `check_zoya.py`, whose purpose is checking Zoya. `us_strategy.py` and
   `explain_compliance.py` both route through the one entry point, and
   `test_single_screening_path.py` enforces that with a static AST import check, so a new
   parallel screening path fails a test the moment it is written.
   Read the module docstring before trusting a verdict: business activity is approximated by
   SIC code, and XBRL cannot separate Islamic from conventional instruments, so both ratios
   are overstated. Both approximations err toward rejection.

   **Cost:** a cold screen is a live SEC fetch of up to ~4.7 MB taking roughly 0.7–2 s, and
   `/paper/preview`, `/stock/{symbol}/profile` and `/stock/{symbol}/explain` all sit on it.
   `sec_edgar_cache.py` — a **temporary shim, not the screening store** — now serves a repeat
   fetch of the same URL from `backend/sec_edgar_cache/` for 24 h and holds live fetches to
   ~8 req/s, under SEC's 10 req/s guidance. Measured: three symbols cold 4.53 s, warm 0.66 s
   with no SEC request at all. It caches raw responses only, never verdicts, and never caches
   a failure — a 404 is a fact about SEC, not about the company, and the screen fails closed
   on ERROR. The append-only `shariah_screens` store in NEXT_STEPS.md still replaces it; delete
   the shim then. Tests are unaffected — they supply a `shariah_override` or swap the
   `sec_request` seam, and none reach SEC or the cache.
2. **Option fills are audited but not tracked as positions.** `portfolio_store` models whole
   shares only — no contract multiplier, strike, expiry, or assignment. `sync_filled_order`
   diverts option fills to `paper_fills` under the OCC symbol and returns
   `OPTION_FILL_RECORDED` without touching `paper_positions`. Alpaca is the source of truth for
   options P&L. Do not "fix" this by booking contracts as shares — that was a real bug.
3. **The strategy layer selects; selecting is not approving.** `option_strategy.py` calls
   `fetch_option_chain` and picks a contract for both Level 1 strategies: 1–7 DTE, the strike
   closest to 4% OTM inside a 2–7% band, filtered for a live bid, a spread under 15% of mid, a
   minimum premium, and a standard 100-share multiplier; sized from owned shares or settled
   cash. It emits an `option_contract` that drops straight into `build_shariah_candidate`, and
   a `rationale` string narrating the choice.

   It is now reachable over HTTP at `GET /stock/{symbol}/option-strategy`, which resolves
   account facts through `broker_account_context` (settled cash, never buying power) and
   returns the proposal plus a `next_step` block: `approved: false`, the four gates not yet
   run named explicitly, and the exact `/paper/preview` body to post next. A proposed contract
   has cleared **nothing** — `test_option_strategy_api.py` asserts a proposal can never read as
   approved, and `test_option_strategy.py` asserts a selected contract still has to clear the
   whole gate chain. The two Level 1 structures are no longer equally proven: a **cash-secured
   put has filled live** against the real broker (see 4 below), while the **covered call has
   not** — it is still exercised only against the mocked seam in `test_option_execution_smoke.py`.
   Nothing has yet written a call against real shares, and the test account cannot currently do
   it: `option_strategy` sizes a covered call from owned shares at the standard 100-share
   multiplier, and `0TCX` holds exactly 1 share of CVX.
4. **The end-to-end chain has run against real Alpaca — twice, on the test account: once
   equity, once option.** Both went preview → approval → `EXECUTE PAPER` → fill → reconcile →
   ledger against `https://paper-api.alpaca.markets` over the `alpaca_mcp` transport, with
   nothing mocked.

   **The equity fill — 2026-08-19.** Order `bc939dcd-edfd-428f-9227-272d2521300f` (`client_order_id
   amanah-queue-5`, queue 5) filled 1 CVX at **206.89** against a **207.60** limit and booked
   into `paper_positions` as `quantity 1.0, average_cost 206.89, cost_basis 206.89,
   realized_pnl 0.0, account_suffix 0TCX, account_type CASH`.

   Verified three ways, which is what makes it evidence rather than a green checkmark: the
   local ledger, the broker's own position (`avg_entry_price`), and the order's
   `filled_avg_price` all read 206.89. That agreement matters because the fill price and the
   limit price differed — `sync_filled_order` computes
   `float(dealt_avg_price or price)`, and since `0.0` is falsy a null fill price would have
   silently booked the **limit** and looked entirely plausible. A second reconcile returned
   `ALREADY_SYNCED` with the quantity still 1.0, so the `UNIQUE(queue_id)` guard holds.

   Evidence trail, all committed:

   | file | what it shows |
   |---|---|
   | `docs/live-trade-evidence/before-CVX.json` | the gate refusing a real order — `REJECT margin_account_not_permitted` while the account was still `MARGIN` |
   | `docs/live-trade-evidence/after-CVX.json` | the first real broker submission after the account fix |
   | `docs/live-trade-evidence/reconciled-CVX.json` | the fill reconciled into the ledger, `outcome: VERIFIED`, `problems: []` |

   **The option fill — 2026-08-20.** A Level 1 **cash-secured put** filled live. Order
   `3f06c708-d8fa-4d3a-8823-e3a78f9b3053` (`client_order_id amanah-queue-11`, queue 11) sold to
   open 1 contract of `AAPL260828P00305000` at **1.02** against a **1.00** limit — a sell-to-open
   filling *above* its limit, which is the correct direction for a credit. It booked to
   `paper_fills` under the OCC symbol and returned `OPTION_FILL_RECORDED`; `paper_positions` was
   **not** touched, so limitation 2 above still holds after a real option fill rather than merely
   in theory.

   Verified the same way, by independent readings agreeing rather than one green checkmark: the
   broker's order record (`filled_qty 1`, `filled_avg_price 1.02`), the broker's own position
   (`AAPL260828P00305000`, side `short`, `qty -1`, `avg_entry_price 1.02`), the locally synced
   fill row (`1.0 @ 1.02`), and settled cash moving 99793.10 → 99895.08 — the 102.00 credit less
   0.02 in fees — all agree.

   Getting there took three queue entries, and the two that failed are worth as much as the one
   that filled:

   | queue | outcome | what it shows |
   |---|---|---|
   | 9 | `PORTFOLIO_SELL_GATE_FAILED` | a real bug — see the fourth bug below |
   | 10 | `BROKER_CANCELLED` | the stale-limit failure again, at speed: 1.05 was the bid at submission and the bid was 1.00 under two minutes later, so it rested instead of crossing. Cancelled with `filled_qty 0`, reconciled, re-quoted. **Re-quote and submit as close together as possible** — an option bid is perishable in a way an equity bid is not. |
   | 11 | `BROKER_FILLED` | the fill above |

   Option evidence trail, all committed:

   | file | what it shows |
   |---|---|
   | `docs/live-trade-evidence/submitted-CVX-option.json` | the first option order to reach a broker at all — OCC symbology, `sell_to_open`, and the confirmation gate accepted, but *not* a fill |
   | `docs/live-trade-evidence/canceled-CVX-option.json` | that order cancelled unfilled, and reconcile handling a terminal **non**-fill: `BROKER_CANCELLED`, `portfolio_sync: null`, nothing written to either table |
   | `docs/live-trade-evidence/filled-AAPL-option.json` | the first real option fill, with the queue 9/10/11 sequence and the bug it exposed |

   **What this does not prove.** It ran on the *test* paper account (`0TCX`) from a *local*
   checkout. The submission demo trade still has to happen on the dedicated hackathon account
   once that is provisioned, and it should be run **against the deployed instance at
   https://amanahtrader.uk, not locally** — `backend/*.db` is gitignored by design, so a
   locally-run trade writes to a local SQLite file that the deployed instance never sees. Its
   positions and fills would simply be absent from the demo. This is not hypothetical: the CVX
   position above lives in the `.worktrees/live-trade-backend` database and appears in no other
   checkout. Run the demo trade through the deployed instance so its own database captures the
   position naturally.

   `test_option_execution_smoke.py` still covers the paths a single live trade cannot: a
   covered call, an unsupported strategy, a margin account, and an under-collateralized
   cash-secured put, through the real FastAPI app with only the `alpaca_request` seam mocked.
   Writing it found and fixed **three** real bugs, all the same shape: an equity-only rule
   applied to options — and a **fourth** of that shape turned up later in live execution, which
   is recorded after them because it was found differently. `agent_coordinator.evaluate_candidate`
   unconditionally blocked any non-BUY side, which made both Level 1 strategies (both
   sell-to-open) unreachable from `/paper/preview` at all (fixed with an `asset_class` param);
   and the portfolio risk overlay treated an option's contracts/premium as equity
   shares/share-price, producing nonsensical exposure percentages that would reject almost any
   option order once a real position existed (fixed by skipping that equity-specific overlay
   for `asset_class == "option"` — `option_structure_gate` and `account_shariah_gate` already
   provide correct option-native sizing); and the same function required a **BUY quant signal**
   for every order, so a fully-collateralized cash-secured put on a Shariah-PASS underlying was
   refused for `quant_no_buy_signal` alone (fixed on 2026-08-20 by scoping that filter to
   non-option orders — see below).

   **A fourth of the same shape surfaced on 2026-08-20, and this one no test caught — a real
   order did.** `paper_execution.validate_sell_reduction` required a local equity position for
   *any* `SELL`, with no `asset_class` exemption. Every Level 1 structure is sell-to-open, so a
   legitimate cash-secured put on an underlying the account holds no shares of was rejected at
   execution time with `no local AAPL position is available` — after clearing the Shariah,
   option-structure, account and risk gates at approval. The reduce-only rule is right for
   equity and meaningless for a sell-to-open option, whose collateral is proven by
   `option_structure_gate` and `account_shariah_gate` at approval time.

   It survived the smoke suite *and* a real live order because of a coincidence: the first live
   option order (CVX, queue 7) happened to sit on top of the 1-share CVX equity position left by
   the equity trade, so the equity check passed for the wrong reason. It took a put on an
   underlying with genuinely zero equity exposure to expose it. The regression test in
   `test_paper_execution_gates.py` is therefore placed **before** the existing `seed_position()`
   call, so it cannot pass by that same coincidence; it was confirmed red before the fix and
   green after.

   The lesson generalises past this one function: a live trade that passes proves less than it
   appears to when incidental account state can satisfy a check the code never meant to apply.

   The quant agent decides whether to open a *directional long*. No Level 1 structure is one: a
   covered call is written against stock already owned, a cash-secured put means "willing to own
   at this price", and buying a short leg back reduces risk. Requiring a breakout for any of them
   blocked the strategy whenever the underlying was merely calm — on 2026-08-20 that was 19 of 21
   liquid large caps scanned. No protection was removed: ownership and collateral are still proven
   by `option_structure_gate` and `account_shariah_gate` at approval time, and the signal is still
   reported in `agent_summary.quant`, just not as a blocker. Directional equity entries are
   unaffected and still require BUY.

   **The fixture masked it, which is why it survived so long.** Scenarios 1–4 send
   `test_fixture: true`, and `paper_test_overrides` injects a `quant_override` of `signal: "BUY"`
   as well as the Shariah verdict — so none of them could see what the quant agent actually says.
   Scenario 5 narrows the fixture to the Shariah verdict only and swaps
   `agent_coordinator.evaluate_quant` for a real `NO_SIGNAL` shape, asserting both that the option
   is approved and that a plain equity BUY on the same underlying is still blocked.

## Style

- Deterministic Python for anything that gates, screens, or executes. No LLM in the decision
  path — a language model may explain a decision but must never make, approve, or bypass one.
- Match the surrounding code: small pure functions, dict returns with a `status` key, fail
  closed on anything unknown.
- Keep `local_api.py` diffs small; it is the file most likely to be touched concurrently.

## Linting and formatting

This project uses Ruff for both linting and formatting. Do not call Black, flake8, isort,
or pylint. There is no `uv` project here — invoke Ruff through the shared `.venv` directly:

- Lint: `.venv\Scripts\ruff.exe check .`
- Lint and auto-fix: `.venv\Scripts\ruff.exe check --fix .`
- Format: `.venv\Scripts\ruff.exe format .`
- Check formatting without writing: `.venv\Scripts\ruff.exe format --check .`

Ruff configuration lives in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.ruff]`. Do not add a separate
`ruff.toml` or `.ruff.toml`. Do not add inline `# noqa` comments without a rule code. The
rule selection is pinned to Ruff's traditional core set (`E4`, `E7`, `E9`, `F`) rather than
its current broader defaults — the broader set found ~100 pre-existing findings across
`backend/` on first run, which were not mass-fixed; expanding the rule set later is a
deliberate decision, not something to do incidentally while touching an unrelated file.

A `PostToolUse` hook (`.claude/settings.json` → `.claude/hooks/ruff_after_edit.py`) runs
`ruff check --fix` and `ruff format` on whatever `.py` file Claude just wrote or edited —
scoped to that one file, never the whole repo, so it can't retroactively touch the
pre-existing findings elsewhere.
