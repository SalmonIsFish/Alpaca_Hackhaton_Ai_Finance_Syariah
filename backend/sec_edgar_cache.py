"""TEMPORARY SHIM -- a flat-file TTL cache and request throttle for SEC EDGAR.

**This is deliberately not the screening store.** ``NEXT_STEPS.md`` specifies an
append-only ``shariah_screens`` table plus a raw EDGAR cache, so that a verdict
can be dated, compared against the previous verdict, and used to detect the
moment a company stops being compliant. None of that is here. This module only
answers one narrow question -- *"have we already downloaded this exact URL
recently?"* -- so that re-recording a demo does not re-download several megabytes
per take and does not push past SEC's ~10 requests/second guidance.

Replace it with the real store after submission. When that lands, delete this
file; nothing depends on its shape except ``sec_edgar_screen.sec_request``.

What it deliberately does **not** do:

- It does not store verdicts, only raw responses. A verdict is a *decision* and
  belongs in an auditable, dated table, not in a cache that expires.
- It does not cache failures. A 404 or a timeout says something about SEC, not
  about the company, and ``sec_edgar_screen`` fails closed on ERROR -- so caching
  one bad request would make a symbol look unscreenable for the whole TTL.
- It does not invalidate on new filings. The TTL is a blunt instrument; checking
  the ``submissions`` endpoint for a newer filing is the correct answer and is
  part of the real store's design.

Configuration (both read from ``backend/.env`` via the environment):

| variable | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| ``SEC_EDGAR_CACHE_TTL_HOURS`` | ``24`` | entry lifetime; ``0`` disables the cache |
| ``SEC_EDGAR_MIN_REQUEST_INTERVAL_MS`` | ``125`` | floor between live fetches (~8/s) |
