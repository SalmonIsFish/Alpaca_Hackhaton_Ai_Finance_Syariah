"""Replit deploy entrypoint: one process, one public port, serving both the
FastAPI API (local_api.app) and the static dashboard together.

Owned by Terminal 1 (frontend/hosting), not local_api.py, per CLAUDE.md's
boundary -- Terminal 2 owns that file exclusively. This module only imports
the existing `app` object, mounts a StaticFiles directory onto it, and
replaces the root route with a redirect to the dashboard; it adds no routes
that could collide with anything local_api.py defines, and it makes no gate,
screening, or execution decisions of its own.

Replit's free tier exposes exactly one public port, which is why the API and
the dashboard -- normally two separate local processes (see CLAUDE.md
"Running it") -- need to be combined here. Local development is unaffected:
`backend/run_local.ps1` / the uvicorn command in CLAUDE.md still start the API
alone, and the dashboard is still opened as a plain file or via its own static
server, exactly as before.

The dashboard's own apiBase default already special-cases this: when
dashboard/index.html is not opened on localhost/127.0.0.1, it defaults the API
base field to same-origin (window.location.origin), so visiting the deployed
URL needs no manual configuration.

Root redirect: local_api.py's own GET / stays exactly as it is (a judge or a
human should still be able to see the JSON route listing by asking for it
explicitly, and test_local_api_smoke.py exercises local_api.app directly,
never this module) -- but a judge pasting the bare Replit domain should land
on the dashboard, not that JSON. Since `app` here is the same object as
local_api.app, not a copy, this module removes local_api's root route and
adds a redirect in its place. That mutation only ever runs when this module
is actually imported as the deploy entrypoint (`uvicorn replit_app:app`);
local dev and the test suite never import replit_app, so local_api.app's own
GET / is untouched in both of those contexts.
