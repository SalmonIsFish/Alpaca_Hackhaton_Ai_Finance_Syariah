"""Append-only audit log of every Shariah screen the US path actually ran.

This is the lean half of the ``shariah_screens`` store specified in
``NEXT_STEPS.md`` -- timestamp, ticker, verdict, and the deciding ratios, so a
verdict can be dated and compared against the one before it. Dividend
purification tracking and the time-varying traffic light described there are
deliberately **not** here; they were scoped out as too much for the remaining
days before submission.

Append-only rather than overwrite-in-place because re-screening has to detect
*change*, and change needs the previous verdict to compare against. That
comparison is what ``previous_status`` and the returned ``changed`` flag carry.

This module must never import ``sec_edgar_screen``. ``test_single_screening_path``
enforces a four-module allowlist for that import, and a store is not on it --
so the limit the ratios were judged against is read off the verdict
(``ratios["limit_pct"]``) rather than imported from the screen.
