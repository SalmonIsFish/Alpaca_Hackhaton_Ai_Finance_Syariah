"""Verify option_strategy picks a defensible strike and refuses to pick a bad one.

The chain is injected rather than fetched, so nothing here touches Alpaca; the one
test that exercises the fetch path swaps option_strategy._load_chain, which is the
single seam every chain read goes through.

The assertions target the *choice and its evidence* — which strike, why that one, and
what the rejected contracts were rejected for — because a selection that lands on the
right strike for the wrong reason is not a rule anyone can defend in a demo.
