"""HTTP view over option_strategy.py: propose a Level 1 contract for a symbol.

option_strategy.py could only be driven from check_option_strategy.py, so a caller
had to hand-build `option_contract` to get an option through /paper/preview. This
module is the missing plumbing, and nothing more -- the selection rules, the policy,
and the rationale all still live in option_strategy.py.

**Selecting is not approving.** A proposed contract has passed no gate. It has not
been screened for the underlying's Shariah status, its structure has not been
checked, the account has not been checked, and no risk limit has been applied. The
payload says so in `next_step`, and hands back the exact /paper/preview body the
caller must post to actually start the gate chain. test_option_strategy.py already
asserts that a selected contract still has to clear everything.

Account facts are passed in by the caller (local_api resolves them through
broker_account_context, the same function the approval path uses) so that settled
cash -- never buying power -- backs a cash-secured put here too.
