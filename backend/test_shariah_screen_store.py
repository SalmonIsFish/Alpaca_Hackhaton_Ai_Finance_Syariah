"""Verify the append-only Shariah screening audit log records what it claims to.

No network and no real database: every case runs against an in-memory SQLite
connection, the same convention test_portfolio_store.py and test_watchlist_store.py
use. The verdict dicts below are the exact shapes sec_edgar_screen.check_us_symbol
returns from each of its six exits -- the point of the suite is that a row survives
whichever exit produced it, including the early ones that carry no ratios at all.
