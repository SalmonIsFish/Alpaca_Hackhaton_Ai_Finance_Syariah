"""Shariah screening for US equities from free SEC EDGAR filings.

Drop-in replacement for ``zoya_compliance.check_us_symbol``: same call shape, same
return shape, so ``agents/shariah_agent.py`` can route to either.

Methodology implemented is the **Securities Commission Malaysia / Shariah Advisory
Council** two-tier screen documented in ``docs/shariah-policy/screening-criteria-breakdown.md``:

1. Business-activity exclusions are automatic disqualifiers regardless of financials.
2. Otherwise interest-bearing debt / total assets and conventional cash / total assets
   must each be **strictly under 33%**.

Ratios are computed from the latest **annual** filing (10-K / 20-F / 40-F), because the
SC review cycle is explicitly "based on the company's latest audited annual financial
statements". Every component of a ratio is read at that one balance-sheet date, so a
ratio is never assembled from figures belonging to different periods.

Scope and honesty limits -- read before relying on a verdict:

- **This is not a certified screening service.** It is a labelled, scoped implementation
  of a published methodology, in the same spirit as ``docs/shariah-policy/README.md``.
  A qualified scholar should review the thresholds and the exclusion table.
- **Business activity is approximated by SIC code.** SEC's SIC classification is a
  filer-selected primary-industry label, not a revenue breakdown. A conglomerate whose
  primary SIC is benign can still earn non-compliant revenue, and this screen will not
  see it. SIC is a reasonable first pass, not a substitute for a revenue-source review.
  Where a SIC block mixes compliant and non-compliant operators, the block is excluded
  rather than admitted, so the error lands on the rejecting side.
- **XBRL cannot distinguish Islamic from conventional instruments.** The SC rule counts
  only conventional cash and interest-bearing debt, excluding Islamic accounts and sukuk.
  Filings do not tag that distinction, so *all* cash and *all* interest-bearing debt are
  counted. That overstates both ratios, which errs toward rejection.
- **The SC qualitative limb is not implemented.** Public perception / image of the
  company's activities is a human judgement, and is left to the human approver.
- Missing data, an unmapped ticker, an untaggable balance sheet, or a fetch error returns
  UNKNOWN/ERROR. A guessed COMPLIANT is never returned.

SEC requires a descriptive User-Agent on every request and blocks bare ones. Set
``SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT`` in backend/.env; there is a working default, but SEC asks that
it identify the requester.
